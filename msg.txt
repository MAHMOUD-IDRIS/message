You are not neccessarly doing good. this girl doesn't want this relationship.
and she is looking for a better life for her. but that doesn't mean she doesn't love you.

you are not the best for her. she doesn't want you. she thinks it's impoosible for you to marry.
she never fail to have reasons to not marry you.

what do you think you should do? 
reply to me when you think about it. this is serious!

I know exactly how you feel. you love her. and you regret driving the situation this far. but she keeps telling you:
it's not your fault. she would have taken the same decision no matter what?
I know you wish to believe that is ture. but hai... so what!
